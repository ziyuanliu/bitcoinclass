# Bitcoin from Scratch class, modules
---

## What?

This is a bitcoin from scratch course where we learn to make a simpler variant of the entire bitcoin protocol from scratch. All you need is a unix-based computer and basic knowledge of Python. While this course is open sourced, I have recorded a complete line-by-line course [here](https://cryptofromzero.com).


## Caveats: what makes this different from Bitcoin

The materials taught here will be largely introduced in a more pythonic object-oriented fashion. The finished product itself is not battled tested against the bitcoin protocol and should *not* be used as such. The code base here is purely for educational purposes and contains zero warranty against financial loss of any kind.


## Credits

The base of this project was largely inspired by: [TinyChain](https://github.com/jamesob/tinychain); the style used in that project is a good standard for aspiring Python engineers.
